## HackRPI 2020 - Trace
# Welcome to Trace
Trace was built with the goal of making COVID contact tracing simple, intuitive, and very easy. Track where you go, get alerts when somebody gets sick, and keep track of your friends' and familiy members' health!

# To try our app
Install the latest LTS version of Node.js. Install Expo after that using:
>npm install -g expo-cli

In the project directory, run:
>expo start

A browser window should open up with a QR code.

Download the Expo app on your phone. Open it up and scan the QR code.

Have fun!
